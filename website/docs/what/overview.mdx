**Protobuffet is a documentation environment for your Protobuf file workspace.**

Protobuf contracts help document object schemas and exposed APIs for your services. These contracts alone provide many benefits, but gaps still remain in the documentation requirements of these services. Protobuffet provides the structure and framework to build complete documentation of your Protobuf file workspace.

Our documentation starts with an enhanced view of the Protobuf contracts. The Protobuffet CLI can parse your Protobuf file workspace to generate modern documentation pages for your project.  This automated, granular documentation is deep linked and can be extended with manual context.

View the [example workspace](/protodocs/Booking.proto) for a preview of the generated documentation.

**Protobuffet is a documentation environment for your Protobuf file workspace.**

Documentation should be driven by the code that it documents, but easily extensible through a structured framework. [Protobuf](/docs/what/protobuf) contracts help document objects and exposed APIs for your services. These contracts alone provide many benefits, but gaps still remain in the documentation requirements of these services. Protobuffet provides the toolset to build complete documentation of your Protobuf file workspace.

Our documentation starts with an enhanced view of Protobuf contracts. The [Protobuffet CLI](https://github.com/protobuffet/docusaurus-protobuffet/tree/master/packages/docusaurus-protobuffet#cli-commands) parses your Protobuf file workspace to generate modern documentation pages for your organization. This automated, granular documentation is deep linked and extensible with our toolset.

View the [example workspace](/protodocs/Booking.proto) for a preview of the generated documentation.

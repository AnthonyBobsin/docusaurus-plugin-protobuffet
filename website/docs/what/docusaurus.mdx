**Protobuffet is a set of packages that extend the Docusaurus site generator with Protobuf views.**

Docusaurus provides a powerful foundation for generating documentation and other content-focused sites. Protobuffet is built on top of this foundation to follow the same standards and practices. Flexibility is important when choosing a documentation framework for your organization and Docusaurus was the best choice for Protobuffet in this area.

I highly encourage you to get familiar with their great documentation, but here is a summary of what it provides for this project:

- Modern Jamstack documentation site.
- Solid React and MDX foundation.
- Support of plugins and themes that allow for easy extension.
- Emphasis on developer-driven documentation.
